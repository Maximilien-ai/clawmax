# ClawMax Status

**Current Version**: v1.9.9

**Development Line**: 2.0.0

**Last Updated**: November 14, 2026

**Status**: `v1.9.9` remains stable. #227 is accepted and merged on main as
`9ad021b0`, after final CI and 574/574 local chat-source checks. RC98 has not been
cut. CI updates #294 (`2f62920a`), #297 (`5ebca2ad`) and #295 (`4e4c11ef`)
are merged after green checks. #300 (`2337cd96`) also merged after full CI.
#299 (`4dffd39c`) and #301 (`513349eb`) also merged after required CI and
CodeQL. #303 merged as `cbd1ee68` after **577/577** final local checks and green
required CI/CodeQL; the live chat context test fix is now on main. #302 merged as
`2979a628` after green required CI/CodeQL and the owner merge. Next #384 aligns
Node 24.22 across Docker/CI; pin/native-runtime tests pass on the candidate and both
Linux architectures. The first full run exposed ZIP promotion incompatibility;
the fix passes focused import/security suites. The 581/581 product retest exposed
broader unit-fixture state leakage, now addressed by a private unit home/workspace
boundary and canary tests. Final full-suite preservation and CI validation remain
pending. Strict frontend typing retains 290 existing diagnostics
with none added by #302. [Impact-based CI](CI_TEST_SCOPE.md) preserves required checks
while limiting workflow/docs-only changes to focused validation. Current work is the [November 14 dependency queue](planning/DEPENDABOT_2026-11-14.md),
with initial classification of all 107 starting issues complete (#273 closed,
106 remain open, none unlabelled). Current-source closure and feedback-topic
verification remain. Installed/provider, security and final
public/private image validation remain open; no new deployment is claimed.

## Historical RC95 source preview on October 27

[Draft PR #304](https://github.com/Maximilien-ai/clawmax/pull/304) combines 13 of
Daniyar's 17 reviewed PRs (all eight new #320–#327 included) on `integration/rc95-daniyar`, with four held for
lifecycle evidence. Acceptance fixes now cover save-ready AI workflows, AI group/community drafts, and refreshed open agent details. The final local integration/validation/coverage suite passes 557/557. Review now ships the RC95 checklist and explicit email submission with retained delivery evidence; live-provider acceptance remains open. See the
[RC95 acceptance file](planning/RC95_PREVIEW_ACCEPTANCE_2026-10-27.md) for the exact
source, engineering limitations, CI/security gate and twelve independent reviewer
checks. Main contains merged RC94 PR #291; this preview has not landed on main.
The existing RC94 images are unchanged; RC95 has no release tag or image yet.

## Earlier release evidence (retained history)

- RC43 public source, image, digest, and combined-image results are retained as historical evidence, but tester feedback made that candidate non-promotable.
- RC45 carries the LM Studio/Gemma, QBO runtime packaging, Builder, optional-skill, Partner navigation, and focused Review repairs. Public source `4ea36c447b3380c4c3cce045b441ec3973edfccb` and amd64/arm64 image publication passed [run 32911120892](https://github.com/Maximilien-ai/clawmax/actions/runs/32911120892); the public manifest digest is `sha256:26d49eb2da975a449db9513ba889f0cd78f064e4fbba2f16458312d69824f688`. The matching authorized combined image passed its private build, contract, smoke, and publication run.
- RC46 adds guaranteed Builder AI Create choices, Claude Code and Factory Droid runtimes, retained-process cleanup, and higher-value branch coverage. Public source `b8f45271e2ef4c4df5f8c1210bbfdab8572b2b36` passed the complete `473/473` local gate and public amd64/arm64 publication plus registry smoke in [run 33211887894](https://github.com/Maximilien-ai/clawmax/actions/runs/33211887894). Matching authorized combined-image validation also passed; restricted source identity and evidence remain with the owning release repository.
- Generic plugin activity remains visible on agent and workflow cards and detail views without encoding external plugin domains into the public host contract.
- Lifecycle and Review are the public product plugins for 2.0. Other deployment-managed plugins remain outside this public repository and image. Public `PLUGINS/test/plugin-*` directories are synthetic contract fixtures only.
- The public partner catalog covers Senso, Opik, GitHub, Resend, Cognee, Gmail, Microsoft 365, and Digo. The [partner contribution guide](../../PARTNERS/README.md) points to each shipped pattern and keeps partner configuration separate from consented Activity Export.
- The [plugin guide](../../PLUGINS/README.md) is the public entry point for plugin creation, host boundaries, and the Lifecycle and Review examples.
- The RC38 source security review has no unresolved Critical or High findings. Final-candidate cloud/on-prem runtime evidence and the completed Review export remain required before promotion; the source review is not a claim that those external gates have passed.
- Real Google and Microsoft provider checks remain pending or require an explicit documented deferral. Synthetic OAuth, authorization, persistence, and adapter coverage is green.

## Active Release Tracks

### 1.9.9 maintenance

- Branch: `release-1.9.9`
- Tag: `v1.9.9`
- Image: `ghcr.io/maximilien-ai/clawmax-dashboard:1.9.9`
- Policy: accept only reproducible release-blocking hotfixes; validate any hotfix as a new RC before promotion.
- Runtime: OpenClaw `v2026.6.11`.

### 2.0.0 development

- Branch: `main`
- Latest tagged test candidate: `2.0.0-test-rc91`; the next candidate number and source SHA are not selected yet.
- Candidate runtime baseline: OpenClaw `v2026.9.7`; verify the packaged core and plugin versions on each installed target.
- Hands-on review: use the [current dual-instance gate](planning/DASHBOARD_2_0_DUAL_INSTANCE_GATE_2026-10-12.md). RC85 and earlier checklists are retained historical evidence.
- External validation: verify the same identified image on MBP14 and test10, including restart, chat, workflows, and plugin persistence.
- Promotion rule: if candidate source changes, cut and validate a new RC. Otherwise promote the exact tested source and image digest.
- Alternate runtime PR #170 is merged in RC46; its source, package, and runtime contracts are green, while hands-on Claude Code and Factory Droid checks remain in the focused Review set.
