# ClawMax Status

**Current Version**: v1.9.0
**Last Updated**: June 24, 2026
**Status**: `v1.9.0` is the current promoted stable release from `main`. `1.9.1-test-rc1` is the active validation target for the next cleanup sprint: test backfill, operator diagnostics follow-through, public template/workflow sync, and remaining DocHub/workflow follow-through.

---

## Current State

- `main` now contains the first `1.8.x` hardening pass, the `1.8.2` simplify/optimize slice, the `1.8.3` Add Agent regression fixes, the `1.8.4` agent delete UI cleanup, the `1.8.5` DocHub/notification polish pass, the `1.8.6` and `1.8.7` follow-through slices, the `1.8.8` template/workflow hardening pass, the `1.8.9` auth/runtime/chat stability pass, and the `1.9.0` workflow/thread/archive/operator hardening follow-through as the current stable baseline.
- The `1.8.x` work is intentionally focused on hardening, simplification, regression safety, lightweight responsiveness wins, and backlog hygiene rather than major new feature scope.
- Dashboard, CI, container images, cloud, and on-prem paths use the same tested OpenClaw `2026.5.26` baseline.
- The release workflow now supports test images (`test-rcN`) and explicit promotion of validated images into official version tags.
- Partner integrations are active product surfaces, including Resend, Cognee, Opik, GitHub, Senso, and partner plugin install/uninstall handling.
- Resend has both dashboard test-email validation and first-party `clawmax-resend` agent-tool execution with runtime-secret support.
- Cognee has a first-pass partner surface for cloud/self-hosted configuration and official OpenClaw plugin lifecycle management.
- The latest reported full local integration run is green with `--with-validation`, including the latest helper/contract coverage for workflow communication-target inference, archived chat restore/continue, workflow notification cleanup, group chat timeline rendering, DocHub preview/navigation behavior, host-agent state override honoring, and aligned chat/runtime diagnostic wording.

- Near-term target: validate `1.9.1-test-rc1`, using the expanded `350`-count wrapper baseline plus cloud/on-prem image checks before deciding whether `1.9.1` needs more stabilization or is ready to promote.
