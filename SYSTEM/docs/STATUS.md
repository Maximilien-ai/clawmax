# ClawMax Status

**Current Version**: v1.9.2
**Last Updated**: June 30, 2026
**Status**: `v1.9.2` is the current promoted stable release. `main` has already moved onto the `1.9.3` line for chat archive correctness, archived conversation restore/resume follow-through, and the newly surfaced cloud/mobile validation regressions on Templates and Workflows.

---

## Current State

- `main` now contains the first `1.8.x` hardening pass, the `1.8.2` simplify/optimize slice, the `1.8.3` Add Agent regression fixes, the `1.8.4` agent delete UI cleanup, the `1.8.5` DocHub/notification polish pass, the `1.8.6` and `1.8.7` follow-through slices, the `1.8.8` template/workflow hardening pass, the `1.8.9` auth/runtime/chat stability pass, the `1.9.0` workflow/thread/archive/operator hardening follow-through, and the promoted `1.9.1` stabilization line as the current stable baseline.
- The `1.8.x` work is intentionally focused on hardening, simplification, regression safety, lightweight responsiveness wins, and backlog hygiene rather than major new feature scope.
- Dashboard, CI, container images, cloud, and on-prem paths use the same tested OpenClaw `2026.5.26` baseline.
- The release workflow now uses explicit versioned RC tags such as `1.9.2-test-rc1`, and promotion consumes those exact validated artifacts into official version tags.
- RC image dispatch must use an advertised branch or tag ref such as `main` or `refs/tags/v1.9.2`, not a raw commit SHA. The workflow now rejects bare SHAs up front and relies on the run `headSha` for exact source traceability.
- Partner integrations are active product surfaces, including Resend, Cognee, Opik, GitHub, Senso, and partner plugin install/uninstall handling.
- Resend has both dashboard test-email validation and first-party `clawmax-resend` agent-tool execution with runtime-secret support.
- Cognee has a first-pass partner surface for cloud/self-hosted configuration and official OpenClaw plugin lifecycle management.
- The latest reported full local integration run on the active `1.9.3` branch head is green with `--with-validation --coverage`, including the expanded `379`-lane wrapper baseline and measured `c8` coverage of `77.32%` statements/lines, `67.39%` branches, and `88.38%` functions.

- Near-term target: cut and validate `1.9.3-test-rc1`, starting from the chat archive list/resume fixes already merged on `main` plus the newly reported Templates mobile overflow and Workflows first-load stall.
- Next likely follow-through: continue `#158` / `#159` until archive metadata, resume, and reload/remount behavior are consistently stable, then close the new `1.9.2` validation regressions in the same line.
